# Introduction
Social media platforms have become a significant source of public sentiment data. Analyzing this data can be valuable for businesses, researchers, and decision-makers to understand how people feel about their products, services, or specific topics. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis and visualize the results.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (>=3.6) installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries (you can install them using pip):
- pandas
- matplotlib
- textblob
pip install pandas matplotlib textblob
# Getting-Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone:[  https://github.com/DIVYA-KUMARI12/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/DIVYA-KUMARI12/PRODIGY_DS_04)

cd social-media-sentiment-analysis

2. Download or prepare your social media data in CSV format and save it in the project directory.

3. Open the Python script sentiment_analysis.py and set the text_column_name variable to the name of the column containing the text data in your CSV file.

4. Run the script:
python sentiment_analysis.py
The script will perform sentiment analysis on the provided data and generate visualizations.

# Usage
- Modify the analyze_sentiment and categorize_sentiment functions in sentiment_analysis.py if needed, to customize the sentiment analysis logic.
- Adjust the visualization settings, such as colors, labels, and plot sizes, in the script to suit your preferences.
# Results
The project generates two main types of visualizations:

1. Average Sentiment by Category Bar Chart: This chart displays the average sentiment polarity for each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, and Neutral). It provides a quick overview of the sentiment distribution within the data.

2. Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart: This chart shows the distribution of sentiments as a percentage of the total data. It offers insights into the overall sentiment balance.

These visualizations can help you better understand public sentiment towards specific topics or brands.
